## Problem Statement
Web3 users often face high transaction fees and complex processes when transferring funds from parent to child wallets. InkCards addresses this by removing the need for multiple wallet transfers, significantly cutting down costs and simplifying fund management.

## Project Description
InkCards responds to this need by offering a platform where pools of funds can be created and managed through the issuance of NFT-based digital debit cards. These cards function as unique, transferable assets with defined spend limits and expiration parameters, which can be utilized directly for transactions, effectively bridging the gap between decentralized fund allocation and real-world expenditure patterns. The system bypasses the layered transaction fees and operational inefficiencies, presenting a seamless method for individuals to exercise financial agency and for entities to govern expenditure in the digital economy.
